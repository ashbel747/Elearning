## Section Six: Introduction To JavaScript

So far, you’ve raised the castle walls with HTML and painted them beautifully using CSS. But right now, your castle is just a display, no guards open the gate, no torches flicker when someone enters, no scrolls deliver secret messages to the king.

Enter **JavaScript,** the magical mechanism that brings your castle to life.

# 💡 **Topic: What is JavaScript?**

🎯 **Goal: To understand what JavaScript is and how it adds functionality and interactivity to web pages.**

Imagine you’re a royal messenger from a neighboring kingdom. You arrive at a castle and approach the gate. A guard steps forward and asks for your name and purpose. If you give the right passcode, he pulls a lever, and the gate opens.

- **HTML** built the gate: its size, placement, and the lever.
- **CSS** made the gate look beautiful: polished wood, gold trim, glowing torches.
- But without JavaScript? The lever is just... decoration.

JavaScript is the **system of gears and pulleys** that responds to action. It makes the gate open when the guard pulls the lever and only when the correct conditions are met. Put simply, it **adds behavior** to your website.

## 🔧 What Can JavaScript Do?

JavaScript is a **general-purpose programming language**, but in the web world, it’s mainly used for:

### On the Frontend

---

- Responding to clicks and keystrokes
- Showing or hiding parts of the page
- Validating form data before it’s submitted
- Dynamically changing content (like updating a score, price, or theme)

### On the Backend (with Node.js)

---

- Saving data to databases
- Handling user authentication
- Running servers and APIs
- Reading/writing files or interacting with the operating system

---

In short, **JavaScript is everywhere on the web;** it powers almost every interaction you’ve ever had with a site.

### ✨ Example: A Button That Counts

Let’s look at a simple but magical example: a button that counts how many times it’s clicked. Click the box below 👇

https://codepen.io/kidus-elias-the-selector/pen/wBvLEdN

<aside>
💡

Every time you click the button, the number increases. That’s JavaScript in action: **interactive and dynamic. Please click on the HTML button to view the code powering the button.**

### 🧪 Quick Activity:

1. Use the link below 👇 to access the code used in the above Example.

   https://codepen.io/kidus-elias-the-selector/pen/wBvLEdN

2. Inside the Codepen, try modifying the script:
   - Change the starting number
   - Make the button increment by 2
   - Try changing the color or text when the number hits 5
3. Once done, please answer these questions inside your notes:
   - What does the `onclick` attribute do?
   - What is `document.getElementById` referring to?

## 📦 Why Learn JavaScript?

Without JavaScript, your websites would be static like castles frozen in time. With it, they become **living, interactive spaces**.

Here’s what makes JS worth learning:

- 🔁 **It’s the language of the web:** supported by every browser
- 💥 **It adds interactivity:** buttons, animations, forms, and more
- 🌍 **It works everywhere**: on the front end, back end, even in mobile and desktop apps
- 📚 **It unlocks advanced skills** in React, Node.js, Express, and full-stack development, all require JS, so it’s a prerequisite for continuing your full-stack journey 😉
