>
> You’re not alone. Every designer, from rookie to pro, has been paralyzed by the “blank canvas curse.”
>
> **But here’s the good news:** Great design isn’t magic. It’s a processa series of simple, practical steps anyone can follow.

## 💡 Topic: What are the 6 stages of design

Design paralysis hits everyone with the fear of starting from scratch, not knowing where to begin. But UI design isn’t magic. Think of it as cooking a meal: gather rough ideas (sketches), build your recipe’s backbone (wireframes), prep key ingredients (components), plan the order of steps (user flows), serve it on a beautiful plate (hi-fi designs), and taste-test it before guests arrive (prototyping).

Each stage is a practical, low-pressure step to move your idea forward. Skipping steps often means wasted work or designs that confuse users. By following the process, you’ll create user-friendly, professional interfaces every time.

| Stage        | Goal                     | Output              | Tools              | Watch Out For…                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Sketches     | Fast idea generation     | Rough doodles       | Paper, Whiteboard  | Overthinking, perfectionism      |
| Wireframes   | Layout & structure       | Black/white layouts | Figma, Balsamiq    | Adding color too soon            |
| Components   | Consistency, reusability | UI Kits, states     | Figma, XD, Sketch  | Custom elements, ignoring states |
| User Flows   | Map user journeys        | Diagrams, arrows    | Flowmapp, diagrams | Missing edge/error cases         |
| Hi-Fi Design | Visual polish, branding  | Final screens       | Figma, XD, Sketch  | Skipping earlier steps           |
| Prototype    | Test & validate          | Clickable mockups   | Figma, InVision    | Not testing with real users      |
